## Permitted Uses (No License Required)

You may use Golden Codex metadata without a license for:

- **Search & Indexing** — Building search indexes, improving discoverability
- **Display & Attribution** — Presenting metadata to users, crediting artists
- **Verification & Provenance** — Validating authenticity, checking ownership

## Restricted Uses (Commercial License Required)

A commercial license is required for:

- **AI/ML Model Training** — Using Golden Codex metadata to train, fine-tune, distill, or improve machine learning models
- **Dataset Aggregation** — Compiling Golden Codex metadata into commercial or redistributable datasets
- **Commercial Derivative Products** — Building paid products or services primarily based on Golden Codex metadata

## Rationale

Golden Codex metadata represents substantial creative and analytical investment:

- **4,000–8,000 tokens** of expert art analysis per image
- **Art historian-level** interpretation unavailable elsewhere
- **Structured provenance** supporting rights management and attribution

This metadata has measurable value in the AI economy. When it contributes to models generating billions in value, the creators and curators should participate in that value exchange.

When it helps users discover, understand, and appreciate art — that's the mission, freely given.
